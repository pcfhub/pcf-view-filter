/**
 * Ask PCFHub what it makes of this manifest.
 *
 * The hub validates with the same class ingestion uses, so the answer here is
 * the answer at import time rather than an approximation of it — which is the
 * whole reason this replaced a local copy of those rules.
 *
 * Never throws. Every failure — offline, DNS, a 500, a timeout, a body that is
 * not the shape expected — comes back as `reachable: false` with a reason, and
 * the caller turns that into a warning. A check script that can fail a release
 * build because a website was briefly down is a check script people disable.

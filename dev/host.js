/*
 * The platform, stood in for: a working `DataSet` with real paging, real
 * sorting and real filtering, plus the switches for the ways a real one
 * misbehaves.
 *
 * Loaded by both `harness.html` in a browser and `smoke.js` in Node, which is
 * why it attaches to `window` *and* assigns `module.exports` and requires
 * neither to exist.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why this exists.** Every dataset control in the catalogue is published at
 * `demo.fidelity: "limited"` for the same reason: the hub's harness seeds a
 * single page, reports no next or previous page, and discards sorting between
 * renders. `npm start` is not much better — it will bind a CSV, but it will not
 * put the control on page three of a sorted view and then change the page size
 * underneath it.
 *
 * So the paging and sorting code in a dataset control — which is most of the
 * hard code in a dataset control — has never been exercised by anything before
 * this file. It ships with twelve records and a page size of five for exactly
 * that reason: three pages is the smallest number that tells you whether page
 * two came from the platform or from a slice.
 *
 * Filtering is thinner still everywhere else: the hub's harness and `npm start`
 * both accept a `setFilter` call and discard it, so a filtered view is one of
 * the few things a control can get *completely* wrong and still demo. Here the
 * expression is applied, the counts follow it, and forgetting the `refresh()`
 * afterwards shows up as a set of rows that did not change.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **The `quirks` switches are the point, not a curiosity.**
 *
 * The scaffolded control carries three repairs for behaviour observed on a real
 * model-driven form, and each one looks like superstition until you can turn
 * the behaviour on:
 *
 *   - `loadNextPage(true)` **ignores its argument** and hands back the whole
 *     range from page one, so `sortedRecordIds` accumulates instead of
 *     replacing. This is why the control slices.
 *   - `hasPreviousPage` **stays false** after paging forward, so a pager driven
 *     by it can never go back. This is why the control counts pages itself.
 *   - `firstPageNumber` **disagrees with the ids**, which is how a range like
 *     "4–9 of 6" gets printed. This is why the label is built from the
 *     control's own counter.
 *
 * Default them to the observed behaviour, not the documented one. A harness
 * that models the platform as it is written down will pass a control that
 * cannot page on a real form — which is the exact failure these switches exist
 * to prevent.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **A stub must never be more capable than the thing it stands in for.**
 * `refresh()` here does not re-render; it records that a render is owed, and
 * the driver decides when to run it. That is deliberate. A `refresh()` that
 * re-entered `updateView` immediately would hide the loop a guarded mutator
 * exists to prevent, and would make an infinite one look like a hang instead of
 * a count.
